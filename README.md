# Potato Disease Classification ðŸŒ±

A deep learning project designed to classify potato leaf diseases, offering an efficient tool for farmers and agricultural experts to diagnose and manage crop health.

## Key Highlights

- **Objective**: Detect and classify potato leaf diseases into the following categories:  
  - Healthy  
  - Late Blight  
  - Early Blight  
  - Bacterial Wilt  
  - Nematode  
  - Pests  
  - Virus  
  - Phytophthora  
- **Model**: Built using the **EfficientNetB0** architecture, known for its balance of speed and accuracy.  
- **Backend**: Deployed with **FastAPI**, ensuring fast, reliable API responses for real-time disease detection.  
- **Frontend**: A dynamic and responsive web interface built using **React.js**, allowing users to upload leaf images effortlessly.  
- **Deployment**: The trained model is saved in `.keras` format and seamlessly integrated into the backend for predictions.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of potato leaves through an intuitive web interface.  
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides disease classification results instantly upon submission.  
- **Modular Architecture**: The project's design ensures scalability and easy integration with additional datasets or models.  
- **Agricultural Impact**: Helps farmers identify diseases early, preventing crop loss and improving yield.
